# Property System Demo App

Hi! To complete this task, I've used:

-   Laravel
-   Inertia/Vue
-   Tailwind
-   Vite
-   MySQL

At the end of Part 1, I've been tasked to create a script which will update my database based on changes to the API. I've not done this as I can't see how to determine when the API has been changed without a webhook to notify my script of a change. If the inverse was meant, I've created an Event which will be called if a Property gets updated on my end.

This took me around 9 hours to complete.
